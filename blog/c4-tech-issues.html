    <h1>Gender Inequality</h1>
    <h4>February 27th, 2015</h4>

  <section>
      <p>
        With very minimal research, it was clear that gender inequality in the technology industry is an issue. A lot of people have many different opinions on the whys and hows and how to remedy this situation moving forward. This is an issue that is certainly near and dear to my heart, as I work toward breaking into this industry as a female.

       There are a lot of studies that have occured, to show the disparity between women and men in the workplace. The numbers are unsurprising, but they are still astounding to see on paper. In the majority of companies surveyed, less than a third of the staff was made up of women. It's disheartening to hear that the typical sterotypes about who should be computing still stand with our younger generations.

        I do not believe that it is men's fault there are not as many women in the workplace. I am sure that there is a large population of women to blame also. We need to stop getting in our way, and being our own biggest critics. Society has taught us to believe that men are just better at certain things, and computing falls into that category. It could be that computing is truely 'building something with your hands' and other careers that are categorized this way are largely male driven industries.

        I was relieved to see often throughout my research that there are many companies who have recognized this as an issue, and are working on making strides toward 'improvement'. However, the idea of mandated equality does concern me. I do not want the market opened up to woman because someone is being forcred. That is putting a band-aid on the situation rather than fixing the root cause.
