    <h1>Conflict</h1>

        In order to attend DBC, I left behind my job in Corporate America. While I only worked there for a little over 2 years, I was able to prove myself and move up quickly. I was given the responsibility of managing a team late last year. My team was small, so there was a lot of dependency on each other to get the work down. Both of my team members were also much older than I am.
      </p>
      <p>
       As always, in the forming stage, everything started out great. Everyone got along, and I was still getting my feet wet with not only managing others, but leading a team that I had never worked with before. It was all new material and systems I had to pick up quickly. Fortunately, one person on my team was fairly tenured and knew the job well. I relied on her to teach me what her responsibilities were so I could learn. Little did I know, this was going to quickly turn into a situation where she felt I was not qualified to do my job, or manage the team. 

      </p>
      <p>
        In the beginning, I brushed it off and figured she would come around. I was too busy trying to play catch up and learn my role. After some time, our communications became short, and her responses were always defensive. I felt that she was rude, and became frustrated on a daily basis. I was angry and annoyed. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I knew that she felt I wasn’t smart enough to do my job. She probably felt threatened by my age, and was never going to take me seriously. Dealing with that situation every day was challenging and definitely tested my patience.

        If I knew then, what I know now, I would have been a little stronger. I would have let go of the ‘let’s be friends’ attitude, and been stronger from the get go. But in the end it taught me a lot. It taught me what I can and cannot handle. It taught me how to ask others for help, and when not to allow others to get involved. It taught me to have patience, but let people walk all over you. I would not wish to go back to that situation, but if I had to, I would be much more prepared for it the second time around.
