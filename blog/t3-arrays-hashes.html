     What is an array?
        An array is an ordered list of objects. Objects can be strings, integers / floats, or other arrays. Each item in an array has a position or an index and can be referred to by calling that position. Think of putting a bunch of people in a line, each person represents either a number or a word. Now put a number on each person's shirt, starting at 0. The entire line will have a name, let's call it "Conga_Line". If I tell ruby to return to me what is in the conga_line at position [3] it would present me with the element of the fouth person.
      </br>
        Remember, arrays always start with the first element in position 0. I can tell ruby to present any one of the index's. I can also give ruby an element, and let it tell me the position of that element. 

        With various methods, I can easily add items to the array, replace items currently included, and remove any items I choose.

      What is a hash?
       Hashes are very similar to arrays. They are also a collection of strings or integers / floats. Elements in a hash are not automatically assigned a position as they are in an array. Instead, each value must be assigned a key. You can call a key to recieve the cooresponding element, the same you can call an array position and return what is there. 

       Hashes also have a default value that will return if you call a key that is not present in the hash. Ruby will give you your default value, rather than an error, if you are asking for something in a hash that does not exist.

        Both options are a great way to organize your data. One is not necessarily better than the other for the types of programs we are creating. If you're working with a large amount of data, depending on how you are looking to manipulate the data will change whether you use an array or a hash, as the run times for each will differ. But for now, you should feel comfortable using either one.
