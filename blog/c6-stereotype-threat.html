    <h1>What is Stereotype Threat?</h1>
    <h4>March 13th, 2015</h4>

        "What is stereotype threat?" seems to be the million dollar question. Before we delve into the whos and whats of the topic, I think we should keep an open mind about how to solve for this, whether it can be changed, and who's responsibile to do so. I've never considered myself to be in one of 'those categories' but it turns out I am. In fact, we all are. Regardless of who you are, what you do, where you come from, you are part of some social class. You're probably part of many. Based on my research, while you can be catagorized many different ways, there is likely one class you identify with. For me, and this is new, I'm a woman in technology. What are you?

       The world is made up of stereotypes. Everyone is judged and catagorized. I believe it's how we make sense of the world. We have to classify people the same way we classify objects, or it would get too confusing. Putting people in groups makes them easy to understand. The issue is when we generalize characteristics and ideas about those people, and assume all objects in a catagory act the same. We all know this is not true, but we continue to do it. The issue happens when you know the negative stereotype of your particular group, and the threat happens when you live up to it. When you perform in the same manner the stereotype told you you should. It may not be a conscious decision, but the study of stereotype threat suggests that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. For example, black students score lower on tests, becuase the stereotype is that they are not as well educated as other students. Women quit or do not attempt to work in the Technology field, becuase it is believed that men are better at it. The studies suggest that participants who are reminded of their stereotypes are quicker to act according to the generalization.

        Personally, I'm working against the "woman cannot be in technology, men are smarter in science fields" and probably a mirage of other stereotypes. I've always been a good math student, I've always excelled at school in general, so I never thought I bought in to any of the ideals that say 'boys are better'. This was until I did some research. Now I believe there may be some truth in all of this. I can honestly say I don't feel as confident as some of my other male peers seem, and am often intimidated by their confidence. Somewhere in my head, I do believe that males are naturally better at programming, and will pick it up quicker, or retain it easier. Through the conversations I've had with some team members, I know that my skill set is not subpar to theirs. I know that their knowledge is not leaps and bounds superior to mine, and that I have just as much of a chance for success as they do. So why can't I shut that little voice off inside my head? It's a difficult task to overcome, believing in yourself when society tells you to not even try. But I do believe the work is worth it. I believe that being aware of what you're working against is half the battle. If you can get over that, understand your enemies (in the metaphorical sense) you can prepare yourself with the tools you need to conquer them. To all my fellow women in technology, we're all in this together, and I can only hope we not only support each other, but support the industry as a whole. It is not only our battle to fight.

        Changing stereotypes is an incredibly difficult thing to do. I'm not even sure it's possible. But what I do know, is that the issue with stereotype threat is not the individuals, it is the stereotypes themselves, and it is everyone's job to help solve for that.
