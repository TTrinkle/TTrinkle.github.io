      The differences between relative, absolute and fixed positioning
    </p>
    <p>
        Understanding the differences between CSS position options can be confusing. If you find yourself randomly chosing a position and then checking what it does you probably do not have a godo handle on the definitions of each 
    </p>
    <p>
        Relative: 
          In order to understand the relative positioning, we should first discuss what static does. Static is the default position of any element until you define a new one. Assigning all elements with a static position will stack them nicely on top of one another to the left. Positioning an element using relative will do exactly the same thing as static, until you apply a direction (top, right, bottom, left), at which point it will move the element accordingly. 

          Note: When applying a direction, the element requires a measurement (ex: left:100px;)
    </p>
    <p>
      Absolute: 
        Using Static and Relative positions require your element to still account for other elements on the page. They will move around each other while still be conscious of where things are. The absolute position does not act the same way. Think of it as putting blinders on your element, so it can only see and worry about it's location. When using an absolute position you must tell your element where to go using top, bottom, left, or right details. Once you've assigned an element to an absolute position, it will remain in that spot even when changing screen sizes. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Fixed:
          A fixed elements works similar to the absolute position. Also requiring details using top, bottom, right or left. However it will not move when you are scrolling on a page. It will remain fixed to the area you told it to be in. You may want to use a fixed position when creating a footer on your page so it stays at the bottom of the page regardless of where you are.

    <p>
     What is an array?
        An array is an ordered list of objects. Objects can be strings, integers / floats, or other arrays. Each item in an array has a position or an index and can be referred to by calling that position. Think of putting a bunch of people in a line, each person represents either a number or a word. Now put a number on each person's shirt, starting at 0. The entire line will have a name, let's call it "Conga_Line". If I tell ruby to return to me what is in the conga_line at position [3] it would present me with the element of the fouth person.
      </br>
        Remember, arrays always start with the first element in position 0. I can tell ruby to present any one of the index's. I can also give ruby an element, and let it tell me the position of that element. 

        With various methods, I can easily add items to the array, replace items currently included, and remove any items I choose. 
    </p>
    <p>
      What is a hash?
       Hashes are very similar to arrays. They are also a collection of strings or integers / floats. Elements in a hash are not automatically assigned a position as they are in an array. Instead, each value must be assigned a key. You can call a key to recieve the cooresponding element, the same you can call an array position and return what is there. 

       Hashes also have a default value that will return if you call a key that is not present in the hash. Ruby will give you your default value, rather than an error, if you are asking for something in a hash that does not exist. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Both options are a great way to organize your data. One is not necessarily better than the other for the types of programs we are creating. If you're working with a large amount of data, depending on how you are looking to manipulate the data will change whether you use an array or a hash, as the run times for each will differ. But for now, you should feel comfortable using either one.
