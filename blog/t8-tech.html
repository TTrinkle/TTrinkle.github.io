        <h2> What is TDD? </h2> <br>
        Test-Driven Development is an approach where a test is written for a desired functionality, and inevitably fails until the code is modified to ensure the tests pass. The tests are written prior to any code. 

      </p>

       <h2> What are the benefits of using TDD? </h2> <br>
       <ul> Allows you to consider the design of the code </ul>
       <ul> Forces you to think about the outcome of the program </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        <h2> How to do I run tests? </h2> 
        In order to run TDD, you will first need a Ruby file. You can create a new file using your terminal by navigating to an appropriate folder, and typing touch filename.rb. Remember, touch will allow us to create a new file. We will also need a Gemfile that can hold the rspec. The Gemfile should contain the source pointing to our newly created ruby file, as well as the ‘rspec’ notation.
