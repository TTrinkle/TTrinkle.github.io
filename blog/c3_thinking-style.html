       According to the Gregorc Thinking Style my mind thinks in a Concrete Sequential (CS) manner. </br>
    </p>
    <p>
      So what does that mean?</br>
       It means my perception is concrete. I often take things at face-value. I like things in a linear fashion. (First step first, then the second step). And, I generally like things that have a plan. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it right?</br>
        Before I took the quiz, I read through all four potential outcomes and knew without a doubt which answer the test was going to yield. I would not say I’m set in my ways, but I understand my thought process, and am aware of the challenges it presents. It’s important to remember that these answers are never meant to be a one-size-fits-all, if it were, we’d like in a very boring world with only 4 types of cookie-cutter personalities. That being said, on the whole, I can identify with most points of a CS mind. 
    </p>
    <p>What are my challenges?</br>
        My style says that working in groups, discussions without a point, and abstract ideas are hard for me. I disagree with these. Whether it is because I have learned to adapt to these situations or because the CS is not a full fit, I’m not sure. I do know that I struggle with allowing people to help if it is easier to do something myself, and like to have an objective to a meeting before it starts, but I would not have pegged these as my personal challenges.
    </p>
    <p> What does this mean for DBC?</br>
        At first, I found the DBC pre-work very overwhelming. It did not feel structured and I had a difficult time figuring out ‘which way was up’. After week 2 concluded, I felt a lot better. I do appreciate the curriculum is broken down into parts each week. That works for me. It is still very hard for me to my own extra research without really knowing what I’m trying to find. 
        My personal preference for learning, is from a book. This works well for the DBC curriculum at the moment, but know that as soon as we get on-site, this was change rapidly. In order to prepare, I’ve made a conscious effort to learn from videos and leverage my peers instead. This will continue to be an area I have to work on, but I am excited to do that here at DBC.
