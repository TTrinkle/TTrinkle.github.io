    <h1>DBC Feedback</h1>
    <h4>March 1st, 2015</h4>

      <p>
        The DBC curriculum has a strong focus on pairing sessions. DBC sets a minimum number of these sessions you must partake in throughout Phase 0, but they do not dictate when or with whom. After each pairing session, you are required to submit feedback to your pair regarding the session. Other people will then rate your anonymous feedback, and if appropriate, your pair will eventually see it.

       Pairing with others can be great or challenging; each pairing session is different. In order to pair with someone, you first must find someone available at the same time you are, and prepared to go over the same piece of curriculum. This is not always easy, you're often left posting on the google plus group asking for a pair, or reaching out to people individually, hoping it works out. I have found this to be the most stressful part of pairing. I am better when there is structure and organization, so the impromptu scheduling of pairing sessions is a struggle. 
        </br>
       Overall, I enjoy the pairing sessions. You often come up with a solution that is slightly different from what you could or would have done on your own. It's great to get another persons perspective, and share ideas. I find pairing to be easier with someone who is on the same knowledge level as myself. People that are really strong on the code and know exactly what they need to do sometimes move too fast, or are less open to suggestions. Finishing a challenge and getting your tests to run successfull is a great feeling, and it is fun to share that with someone else.

        After each session, you provide feedback for your pair. Conversly at the end of the week, you recieve the feedback people wrote for you. I was excited to get my first set of feedback. I have a lot of experience providing and recieving feedback in other forums so I knew what I could expect, good and constructive. The feedback from your pairs is helpful. It can open your eyes to things that you do that you may not even be aware of prior. One of the things I've taken from the feedback is to read through the challenges before the session so I can have a better understanding of what needs to be done going into it. 
        </br>
        It can be difficult to write constructive feedback for someone you have paired with. Especially since the feedback is never truly anonymous. Each pairing session is so unique, you can usually tell which feedback came from which session. Even though writing the feedback can be awkward at times, I do beleive it is very helpful and necessary for other's success.
